> We have a little something for all of you coming back from vacation, and all of us who barely had any:
>
> - we’ve rebuilt Prototypo from the ground up and the latest beta is online on [app.prototypo.io](http://app.prototypo.io) (use your existing username and password),
> - we’ve opened a Slack room where you can chat directly with members of the team: [slackin.prototypo.io](http://slackin.prototypo.io) (during office hours, central european time, mainly),
> - and did you notice we've redesigned our home-page? [www.prototypo.io](http://www.prototypo.io)
>
> More than a year has passed since the end of our KickStarter campaign and the release of the first beta. We quickly realized that a lot of work was still required to meet designers’ needs: a tool that is easy to use, that allows to create original and personal typefaces of high quality.
