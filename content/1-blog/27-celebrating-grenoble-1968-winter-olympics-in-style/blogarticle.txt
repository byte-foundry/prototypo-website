<legend>prototypo-LM-series-002 for Magnar SOLBERG (based on Spectral)</legend>
"<em>The fulls and the untieds, sometimes turned upside down, agree here with the serifs to end up in perfect harmony. Elzevir plays with a lot of typographic rules.</em>"

"<em>When it comes to sticking together, Prototypo Grotesk leaves no one behind. We expand and we incorporate more prominent serifs, making connections between the letters</em>."
