Schema Projects is a Brooklyn based gallery dedicated to works on paper. Some time ago they commisionned the studio  <a href="http://kikuobata.com/" target="_blank">Kiku Obata & Company</a> to design the visual identity of the gallery. The project included a custom font intented to be used on their communication medias (exhibition cards, ads, signage, invites and totes). They got the job done with style and … Prototypo!

The challenge lay in getting a sophisticated but subtle result so that attention remains on the artists and not on the identity of the gallery. The designers started from Prototypo Grotesk to draw a custom typeface in a single weight, for the logo and to use across all materials. 

** An idea + Prototypo + Some adjustments = A winning combination! **

First, Kiku Obata & Company’s team had an overall idea of the final rendering. The following step was to set the global tone of the font by adjusting the proportions and other details in Prototypo. Then they exported the font to refine it in a classic typeface software.

The comma especially caught our attention, because of its radical design. A small detail that counts!

Thank you Kiku Obata for the first embroidered Prototypo’s font, a “haute couture” work!

We warmly commend the high professionalism with which the project was completed!
That’s the way we like it!
