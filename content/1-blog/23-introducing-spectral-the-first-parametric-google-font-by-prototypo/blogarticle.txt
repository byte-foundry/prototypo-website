Google has called on <a href="https://productiontype.com/" target="_blank"> Production Type</a>'s expertise in digital typography to design this new typeface. Spectral is expected to fill a lack of extensive serif families and shows that a serif font can be perfectly readable on all kind of screens. The latest Google Font is already in the line of high-quality typefaces created for digital media in the past, like Georgia, Trinité or Demos.

##Turning a Google font into a parametric template
Run by our associate, Jean Baptiste Levée, Production Type is known worldwide for the creation of custom typefaces for brands such as Louis Vuitton, Printemps or Ubisoft. 
The release of Spectral's parametric version is the result of a year-long collaboration between our teams and the french digital type design agency.

##A global excitement both on tech blogs and forums
This release has sparked a global excitement on the web, media putting the parametric technology in perspective.
According to <a href="https://thenextweb.com/google/2017/06/22/google-responsive-font-spectral/#.tnw_ZbLgNx64" target="_blank">The Next Web</a>, “*Spectral follows the principles of responsive design, which means the font retains the capacity to alter its form in order to seamlessly fit in with the overall layout of your page.*” For <a href="http://designtaxi.com/news/393768/Spectral-Google-s-First-Parametric-Font-That-s-Responsive-And-Customizable/"target="_blank">Design Taxi</a>, “*the parametric font technology enables designers to develop unique identities*” while <a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/90131239/this-tool-is-built-to-make-responsive-type-a-reality" target="_blank">Fastco Design</a> notes that Prototypo’s technology “*has exciting implications for responsive design, which requires different variants for different screens. *”
