Content1:

We know what a waste of time it can be to search for the perfect font without finding it.

We also know the months it takes to draw one from scratch. That's why we built Prototypo, an online app that enables designers to customize their own typeface in a few clicks.

----

Title2: How does it work?

----

Content2: Creating a prototype for an original typeface, a custom logo for your brand/client or experimenting with type design ideas has never been so easy.
