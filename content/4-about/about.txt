  membername: Yannick Mathey
  memberjob: Co-founder, art director
  memberdescription: 'YM is specialist in nothing and curious about everything. It was during his last year of studies at ESAD Strasbourg that he discovered his passion for type design. His final year of studies gave him a year of "free time" to learn the basics of letters & code, and develop the alpha version of prototypo with <a href="https://processing.org" target="_blank" class="colorDarkest ">Processing</a>.'

  membername: MJ
  memberjob: Community manager
  memberdescription: "MJ is my name, and I've been kind enough to accept the role of author on this blog and community manager for Prototypo. You have to excuse my English because I'm just a cat, and keyboards aren't really meant for paws. When I'm not tweeting, I enjoy chasing mouse cursors, chewing headphone cables, making a mess in YM's houseplants, causing LRB to sneeze, and sleeping on people's lap without their consent."
