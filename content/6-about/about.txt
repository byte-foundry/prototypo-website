  memberdescription: 'YM is specialist in nothing and curious about everything. It was during his last year of studies at ESAD Strasbourg that he discovered his passion for type design, a mix between two different but complementary educations: the classic type design and historical perspectives by Pierre Roesch and self-taught approach, more free but equally refined with Pierre Di Sciullo. His final year of studies gave him a year of "free time" to learn the basics of letters & code, and develop the alpha version of prototypo.'

  memberdescription: "LRB 's passion is to create websites and web-apps. He fell in love with JS in 2004 and has contributed patches and features to jQuery 1.X (if you have browsed the web in the past 9 years, you've used some code he wrote). He's an active mozillian since 2009 and was an intern at Mozilla Paris in 2011. He's helped start a local JS meetup: lyonJS."

  membername: VS
  memberdescription: 'VS is a long-time friend of YM and has extensive experience in managing products and getting them into the hand of users. Moreover, he’s the bravest of all humans in the team: YM and LRB also experimented the wet climate of UK, but VS endured it and still lives in London. We believe this makes him really fit for his position.'

  membername: MJ
  memberdescription: "MJ is my name, and I've been kind enough to accept the role of author on this blog and community manager for Prototypo. You have to excuse my English because I'm just a cat, and keyboards aren't really meant for paws. When I'm not tweeting, I enjoy chasing mouse cursors, chewing headphone cables, making a mess in YM's houseplants, causing LRB to sneeze, and sleeping on people's lap without their consent."
