His final year of studies gave him a year of "free time" to learn the basics of letters & code, and develop the alpha version of prototypo with <a href="https://processing.org" target="_blank" class="colorDarkest ">Processing</a>.'

  membername: François Poizat
  memberjob: Developer
  memberdescription: |
    François is the hidden twin brother of Wikipedia: he knows everything about everything, or at least he knows just enough to convince his teammates that he does. A question about Schrödinger’s cat? He has the answer. But at Prototypo he is in charge of shipping a lot of very cool features. Since he got his engineer degree at INSA, he has been involved in many research projects in France and Japan.
    Ohayō François!

  membername: MJ
  memberjob: Community manager
  memberdescription: "MJ is my name, and I've been kind enough to accept the role of author on this blog and community manager for Prototypo. You have to excuse my English because I'm just a cat, and keyboards aren't really meant for paws. When I'm not tweeting, I enjoy chasing mouse cursors, chewing headphone cables, making a mess in YM's houseplants, causing LRB to sneeze, and sleeping on people's lap without their consent."
