# Prototypo | Create your own font in just a few clicks

## The first real time font creation software with no drawing skills required

The web application Prototypo gives anyone the possibility to create personalized fonts and export them to use on their website or desktop application such as Word or InDesign.

“We’ve built Prototypo because we were frustrated by the difficulty of finding original fonts perfectly fitting our specific needs, and the months it takes to draw custom ones” said the art director and cofounder Yannick Mathey. Prototypo offers a new approach to typography that integrates historical, mathematical, visual rules of this discipline and automates repetitive tasks to let users focus on overall design. The user can modify the shape and proportion of each letter in the Latin alphabet by playing around with more than 20 sliders. This innovative approach to type design brings users the opportunity to get stronger visual identity with original fonts or to spend a lot of time on traditional drawing softwares.

## An international community 

Since May 2014, date of their first fundraising on the crowdfunding platform (link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/599698621/prototypo-streamlining-font-creation text: “Kickstarter”), more than 1.800 people from all over the world pre-ordered one year access to the web-app. Today, they count 3.000 followers on twitter, 3.500 fans on Facebook and 18.000 subscribers to their newsletter mainly in the US. This first step strengthened the ambitions of their creators: “our first users come from over 35 different countries, which represents a pool of more than one million graphic designers. Going forward, we want to help them create the perfect font by bringing Prototypo closer to their creation: the first step is to provide the ability to instantly preview their font on any website.” said Louis-Rémi Babé the lead developer and cofounder of Prototypo.

## Launching online! 

After a year of R&D and private beta testing, Prototypo is now publicly available with a launch price of $8 per month and it comes with 2 parametrics typefaces designed by our partner (link: https://www.productiontype.com/ text: Production Type)!

## About the creators

Created in May 2013 by Yannick Mathey and Louis-Rémi Babé in Lyon, Prototypo is a startup which provides the first real time and easy font creation software. Their successful fundraising on kickstarter brought them three times the amount they expected (around 50.000€) and allowed them to establish and grow a popularity development in the graphic and type designers’ community as well as typography enthusiasts’ community.


Enjoy,
